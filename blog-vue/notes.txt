Project: Build a blog post editor

Instructions: You are to create a simple blog post editor using Vue.js. The blog post editor should have the following features:

1.    A form that allows users to create a new blog post by entering a title, body, and author name.
2.    A list of all existing blog posts, including their title, body, and author name.
3.    The ability to delete existing blog posts.
4.    The ability to edit existing blog posts by clicking on them and updating their title, body, or author name.
5.    All data should be persisted using Vuex and a mock API.

Requirements:

- Use Vue.js for the frontend.
- Use Vuex for state management.
- Use a mock API to persist data (you don't need to build a backend).
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Use best practices for organizing your code, including using components, mixins, and filters where appropriate.
- Use CSS to style the user interface.
